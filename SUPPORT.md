# Getting Help

## Troubleshooting

- Have you tried refreshing the page?
- Are you on the latest version?
  - [Check the latest release number](https://github.com/alejandro5042/azdo-userscripts/releases)
  - See what version you have installed ([Tampermonkey docs](http://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q101))
  - If you're out-of-date, update your userscript and then hit refresh ([Tampermonkey docs](http://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q101))
- Are there are any interesting errors in the JavaScript console?
  - [Documentation for most major browsers](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/how-to-find-javascript-errors-with-your-browsers-console/)
- Does it work in another browser?
- Does it work in the other Azure DevOps URL scheme?
  - dev.azure.com/mystuff vs. mystuff.visualstudio.com
